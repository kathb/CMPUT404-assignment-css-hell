<p class="center"><span class="big">SCENE ONE</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alice’s</span> <i>home.</i> <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span> <i>is discovered, playing chess.
Golden-haired</i> <span class="smcap">Alice</span>, <i>in a little blue dress, a black kitten in her arms,
stands watching him.</i></p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s a funny game, uncle. What did you do then?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">A red pawn took a white pawn; this way. You see, Alice, the chessboard is
divided into sixty-four squares, red and white, and the white army tries
to win and the red army tries to win. It’s like a battle!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">With soldiers?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">Yes, here are the Kings and Queens they are fighting for. That’s the Red
Queen and here’s the White Queen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">How funny they look!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">See the crowns on their heads, and look at their big feet.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s a foot apiece, that’s what it is! Do they hump along like this?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">Here! You’re spoiling the game. I must keep them all in their right
squares.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I want to be a queen!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">Here <i>you</i> are [<i>he points to a small white pawn</i>] here <i>you</i> are in your
little stiff skirt!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">How do you do, Alice!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">And now you are going to move here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Let me move myself.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">When you have traveled all along the board this way and haven’t been taken
by the enemy you may be a queen.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Why do people always play with kings and queens? Mother has them in her
playing cards too. Look!</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>goes to the mantel and takes a pack of playing cards from the
ledge.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Here’s the King of Hearts and here’s his wife; she’s the Queen of
Hearts—isn’t she cross-looking? wants to bite one’s head off.</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Carroll</span> <i>moves a pawn.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">You’re playing against yourself, aren’t you?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s one way of keeping in practice, Alice; I have friends in the
university who want to beat me.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">But if you play against yourself I should think you’d want to cheat!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">Does a nice little girl like you cheat when she plays against herself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Oh! I <i>never</i> do! I’d scold myself hard. I always pretend I’m <i>two</i> people
too. It’s lots of fun, isn’t it? Sometimes when I’m all alone I walk up to
the looking glass and talk to the other Alice. She’s so silly, that Alice;
she can’t do anything by herself. She just mocks me all the time. When I
laugh, she laughs, when I point my finger at her, she points her finger at
me, and when I stick my tongue out at her she sticks her tongue out at me!
Kitty has a twin too, haven’t you darling?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>goes to the mirror to show Kitty her twin.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’ll have to write a book some day about Alice—Alice in wonderland,
“Child of the pure unclouded brow and dreaming eyes of wonder!” or, Alice
through the looking glass!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Don’t you wish sometimes you could go into looking-glass house? See!</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>stands on an armchair and looks into the mirror.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">There’s the room you can see through the glass; it’s just the same as our
living-room here, only the things go the other way. I can see all of
it—all but the bit just behind the fireplace. Oh! I do wish I could see
that bit! I want so much to know if they’ve a fire there. You never <i>can</i>
tell, you know, unless our fire smokes. Then smoke comes up in that room
too—but that may be just to make it look as if they had a fire—just to
pretend they had. The books are something like our books,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> only the words
go the wrong way. Won’t there ever be any way of our getting through,
uncle?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">Do you think Kitty would find looking-glass milk digestible?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It doesn’t sound awful good, does it; but I might leave her at home. She’s
been into an awful lot of mischief today. She found sister’s knitting and
chased the ball all over the garden where sister was playing croquet with
the neighbors. And I ran and ran after the naughty little thing until I
was all out of breath and so tired! I am tired.</p>

<p>[<i>She yawns and makes herself comfortable in the armchair.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p>[<i>Replaces the playing cards on the mantel and consults his watch.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Take a nap. Yes, you have time before tea.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>[<i>Half asleep.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">We’re going to have mock turtle soup for supper! I heard mamma tell the
cook not to pepper it too much.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Carroll</span></p>

<p class="dent">What a funny little rabbit it is, nibbling all the time!</p>

<p>[<i>He leans gently over the back of her chair, and seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> that she is
going to sleep puts out the lamp light and leaves the room. A red glow
from the fireplace illumines</i> <span class="smcap">Alice.</span>]</p>

<p>[<i>Dream music. A bluish light reveals the</i> <span class="smcap">Red Chess Queen</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">White
Chess Queen</span> <i>in the mirror.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p>[<i>Points to</i> <span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>and says in a mysterious voice.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">There she is, let’s call her over.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Do you think she’ll come?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’ll call softly, Alice!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Hist, Alice.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Alice!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Hush—if she wakes and catches us—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Both Queens</span></p>

<p class="dent">Alice, come through into looking-glass house!</p>

<p>[<i>Their hands beckon her.</i>]</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rises, and talks sleepily. The Queens disappear.</i> <span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>climbs from the
arm of the chair to the back of another and so on up to the mantel ledge,
where she picks her way daintily between the vases.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">I—don’t—know—how—I—can—get—through. I’ve tried—before—but the
glass was hard—and I was afraid of cutting—my fingers—</p>

<p>[<i>She feels the glass and is amazed to find it like gauze.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Why, it’s soft like gauze; it’s turning into a sort of mist; why, it’s
easy to get through! <i>Why—why</i>—I’m going <i>through</i>!</p>

<p>[<i>She disappears.</i>]</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="big">SCENE TWO</span></p>

<p>[<i>Is Scene One, reversed. The portieres are black and red squares like a
chessboard. A soft radiance follows the characters mysteriously. As the
curtain rises</i> <span class="smcap">Alice</span> <i>comes through the looking glass; steps down, looks
about in wonderment and goes to see if there is a “fire.” The</i> <span class="smcap">Red Queen</span>
<i>rises out of the grate and faces her haughtily.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Why, you’re the Red Queen!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Of course I am! Where do you come from? And where are you going? Look up,
speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I only wanted to see what the looking glass was like. Perhaps I’ve lost my
way.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t know what you mean by your way; all the ways about here belong to
<i>me</i>. Curtsey while you’re thinking what to say. It saves time.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’ll try it when I go home; the next time I’m a little late for dinner.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s time for you to answer now; open your mouth a <i>little</i> wider when you
speak, and always say, “Your Majesty.” I suppose you don’t want to lose
your name?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">No, indeed.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">And yet I don’t know, only think how convenient it would be if you could
manage to go home without it! For instance, if the governess wanted to
call you to your lessons, she would call out “come here,” and there she
would have to leave off, because there wouldn’t be any name for her to
call, and of course you wouldn’t have to go, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">That would never do, I’m sure; the governess would never think of excusing
me from lessons for that. If she couldn’t remember my name, she’d call me
“Miss,” as the servants do.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, if she said “Miss,” and didn’t say anything more, of course you’d
miss your lessons. I dare say you can’t even read this book.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s all in some language I don’t know. Why, it’s a looking-glass book, of
course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right
way again.</p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 4em;"><span class="smcap">Jabberwocky</span></span><br>
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;</span><br>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the mome raths outgrabe.</span></p>

<p class="dent">It seems very pretty, but it’s <i>rather</i> hard to understand; somehow it
seems to fill my head with ideas—only I don’t exactly know what they are.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">I daresay you don’t know your geography either. Look at the map!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>[<i>She takes a right angle course to the portieres and points to them with
her sceptre.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s marked out just like a big chessboard. I wouldn’t mind being a pawn,
though of course I should like to be a Red Queen best.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s easily managed. When you get to the eighth square you’ll be a
Queen. It’s a huge game of chess that’s being played—all over the world.
Come on, we’ve got to run. Faster, don’t try to talk.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I can’t.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Faster, faster.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Are we nearly there?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Nearly there! Why, we passed it ten minutes ago. Faster. You may rest a
little now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Why, I do believe we’re in the same place. Everything’s just as it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, in our country you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you ran
very fast for a long time as we’ve been doing.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">A slow sort of country. Now <i>here</i> you see, it takes all the running <i>you</i>
can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you
must run at least twice as fast as that.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’d rather not try, please! I’m quite content to stay here—only I <i>am</i> so
hot and thirsty.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">I know what you’d like.</p>

<p>[<i>She takes a little box out of her pocket.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Have a biscuit?</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Alice</span>, <i>not liking to refuse, curtseys as she takes the biscuit and
chokes.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">While you’re refreshing yourself, I’ll just take the measurements.</p>

<p>[<i>She takes a ribbon out of her pocket and measures the map with it.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">At the end of two yards I shall give you your directions—have another
biscuit?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">No thank you, one’s <i>quite</i> enough.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Thirst quenched, I hope? At the end of three yards I shall repeat
them—for fear of your forgetting them. At the end of <i>four</i>, I shall say
good-bye. And at the end of five, I shall go! That Square belongs to
Humpty Dumpty and that Square to the Gryphon and Mock Turtle and that
Square to the Queen of Hearts. But you make no remark?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I—I didn’t know I had to make one—just then.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">You <i>should</i> have said, “It’s extremely kind of you to tell me all this,”

<p class="dent">You’re Humpty Dumpty! Just like an egg.</p>

<p class="dent">However, this conversation is going on a little too fast; let’s go back to
the last remark but one.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’m afraid I can’t remember it.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">In that case we start fresh, and it’s my turn to choose a subject.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">You talk about it just as if it were a game.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">So here’s a question for you. How old did you say you were?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Seven years and six months.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">Wrong! You never said a word about it. Now if you’d asked <i>my</i> advice, I’d
have said, “Leave off at seven—but—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I never ask advice about growing.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">Too proud?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">What a beautiful belt you’ve got on. At least, a beautiful cravat, I
should have said—no, a belt, I mean—I beg your pardon. If only I knew
which was neck and which was waist.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">It is a—<i>most—provoking</i>—thing, when a person doesn’t know a cravat
from a belt.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I know it’s very ignorant of me.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. There’s glory for
you.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t know what you mean by “glory.”</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more
nor less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">The question is, whether you <i>can</i> make words mean different things.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">The question is, which is to be master—that’s all. Impenetrability!
That’s what I say!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Would you tell me, please, what that means?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">I meant by “impenetrability” that we’ve had enough of that subject, and it
would be just as well if you’d mention what you mean to do next, as I
suppose you don’t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s a great deal to make one word mean.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">When I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Oh!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">Ah, you should see ’em come round me of a Saturday night, for to get their
wages, you know. That’s all—Good-bye.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Good-bye till we meet again.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">I shouldn’t know you again, if we <i>did</i> meet, you’re so exactly like other
people.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">The face is what one goes by, generally.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s just what I complain of. Your face is the same as everybody
has—the two eyes—so—nose in the middle, mouth under. It’s always the
same. Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instance—or the mouth at the top—that would be <i>some</i> help.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It wouldn’t look nice.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Humpty Dumpty</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Ah! Then yours wasn’t a really good school. Now at <i>ours</i> they had at the
end of the bill, French, music, <i>and washing</i>—extra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">You couldn’t have wanted it much; living at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">I couldn’t afford to learn it, I only took the regular course.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">What was that?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with, and then the different
branches of Arithmetic—Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I never heard of Uglification. What is it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Never heard of uglifying! You know what to beautify is, I suppose?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Yes, it means—to—make—anything—prettier.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well then, if you don’t know what to uglify is, you <i>are</i> a simpleton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">What else had you to learn?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, there was Mystery; Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography,
then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger eel, that used to
come once a week; what <i>he</i> taught us was Drawling, Stretching, and
Fainting in Coils.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">What was <i>that</i> like?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, I can’t show it you, myself. I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learned it.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Hadn’t time; I went to the Classical master, though. He was an old crab, <i>he</i> was.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">I never went to him; he taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">So he did, so he did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">And how many hours a day did you do lessons?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Ten hours the first day, nine the next, and so on.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">What a curious plan!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s the reason they’re called lessons, because they lessen from day to day.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Of course it was.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">And how did you manage on the twelfth?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s enough about lessons, tell her something about the games now.</p>

<p class="dent">You may not have lived much under the sea—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I haven’t.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">No, indeed. What sort of a dance is it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Two lines; seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you’ve cleared
all the jellyfish out of the way—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent"><i>That</i> generally takes some time.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">You advance twice—</p>

<p class="dent">Change lobsters, and retire in same order.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">The lobsters!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Come, let’s try the first figure. We can do it without lobsters, you know;
which shall sing?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="poem"><span style="margin-left: 8em;">First Verse</span><br>
“Will you walk a little faster!” said a whiting to a snail,<br>
“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.<br>
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!<br>
They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?<br>
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?<br>
Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?<br>
<br>
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Second Verse</span><br>
“You can really have no notion how delightful it will be<br>
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”<br>
But the snail replied, “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—<br>
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.<br>
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.<br>
Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Thank you; it’s a very interesting dance to watch, and I do so like that
curious song about the whiting.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Oh, as to the whiting, they—you’ve seen them, of course?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Yes, I’ve often seen them at din—</p>

<p>[<i>Checks herself hastily.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t know where Din may be, but if you’ve seen them so often, of course
you know what they’re like.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I believe so, they have their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">You’re wrong about the crumbs, crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But
they <i>have</i> their tails in their mouths; and the reason is—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>[<span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span> <i>yawns and shuts his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Tell her about the reason and all that.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">The reason is, that they <i>would</i> go with the lobsters to the dance. So
they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got
their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn’t get them out again.
That’s all.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Thank you, it’s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting
before.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">I can tell you more than that, if you like. Do you know why it’s called a whiting?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I never thought about it. Why?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent"><i>It does the boots and shoes.</i></p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Does the boots and shoes!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Why, what are <i>your</i> shoes done with? I mean, what makes them so shiny?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">They’re done with blacking, I believe.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Boots and shoes under the sea, are done with whiting. Now you know.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">And what are they made of?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Gryphon</span></p>

<p class="dent">Soles and eels, of course; any shrimp could have told you that.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">If I’d been the whiting, I’d have said to the porpoise, “Keep back,
please; we don’t want <i>you</i> with us.”</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">They were obliged to have him with them, no wise fish would go anywhere
without a porpoise.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Wouldn’t it really?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Mock Turtle</span></p>

<p class="dent">Of course not; why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a
journey, I should say, “With what porpoise?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">No, I give it up, what’s the answer?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">I haven’t the slightest idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">March Hare</span></p>

<p class="dent">Nor I.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I think you might do something better with the time, than wasting it in
asking riddles that have no answers.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">If you knew Time as well as I do, you wouldn’t talk about wasting <i>it</i>.
It’s <i>him</i>.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t know what you mean.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Of course you don’t. I dare say you never even spoke to Time.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Perhaps not, but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Ah, that accounts for it. He won’t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on
good terms with him, he’d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For
instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in the morning, just time to begin
lessons. You’d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling! Half past one, time for dinner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">March Hare</span></p>

<p class="dent">I only wish it was.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">That would be grand, certainly, but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it,
you know.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Not at first, perhaps, but you could keep it to half past one as long as
you liked.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Is that the way <i>you</i> manage?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Not I, we quarreled last March—just before <i>he</i> went mad, you know. It
was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing.</p>

<p class="poem">“Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!<br>
How I wonder what you’re at!”</p>

<p class="dent">You know the song, perhaps.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse when the Queen bawled out, “He’s
murdering the time! Off with his head!”</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">How dreadfully savage!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">And ever since that, he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Is that the reason so many tea things are put out here?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Yes, that’s it; it’s always tea time, and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Then you keep moving round, I suppose?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Hatter</span></p>

<p class="dent">Exactly so, as the things get used up.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Duchess</span></p>

<p class="dent">I quite agree with you, and the moral of that is—“Be what you would seem
to be;” or, if you’d like it put more simply, “Never imagine yourself not
to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or
might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have
appeared to them to be otherwise.”</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">But she said a great deal more than that. Ah, yes, so much more than that.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">So you did, you know; always speak the truth—think before you speak—and
write it down afterwards.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I’m sure I didn’t mean—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s just what I complained of. You <i>should</i> have meant! What do you
suppose is the use of a child without any meaning? Even a joke should have
some meaning—and a child’s more important than a joke, I hope. You
couldn’t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t deny things with my <i>hands</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Nobody said you did. I said you couldn’t if you tried.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She’s in that state of mind, that she wants to deny <i>something</i>—only she
doesn’t know what to deny!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">A nasty, vicious temper. I invite you to Alice’s dinner party this afternoon.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">And I invite <i>you</i>.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I didn’t know I was to have a party at all; but if there is to be one, I
think I ought to invite the guests.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">We gave you the opportunity of doing it, but I dare say you’ve not had
many lessons in manners yet.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Manners are not taught in lessons; lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Can you do addition? What’s one and one and one and one and one and one
and one and one and one and one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I don’t know. I lost count.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She can’t do addition; can you do subtraction? Take nine from eight.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Nine from eight I can’t, you know, but—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She can’t do subtraction. Can you do division? Divide a loaf by a
knife—what’s the answer to that?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I suppose—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p>[<i>Answers for her.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Bread and butter, of course. Try another subtraction sum. Take a bone from a dog; what remains?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">The bone wouldn’t remain, of course, if I took it—and the dog wouldn’t
remain; it would come to bite me—and I’m sure I shouldn’t remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Then you think nothing would remain?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I think that’s the answer.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Wrong as usual; the dog’s temper would remain.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">But I don’t see how—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Why, look here; the dog would lose its temper, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Perhaps it would.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">They might go different ways! What dreadful nonsense we <i>are</i> talking.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Both Queens</span></p>

<p class="dent">She can’t do sums a bit!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Can <i>you</i> do sums?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">I can do addition, if you give me time—but I can’t do <i>subtraction</i> under
<i>any</i> circumstances.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Of course you know your A, B, C?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">To be sure I do.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">So do I; we’ll often say it over together, dear. And I’ll tell you a
secret—I can read words of one letter. Isn’t that grand? However, don’t
be discouraged. You’ll come to it in time.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Can you answer useful questions? How is bread made?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I know <i>that</i>! You take some flour—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Where do you pick the flower? In a garden or in the hedges?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Well, it isn’t <i>picked</i> at all. It’s ground—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">How many acres of ground? You mustn’t leave out so many things.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Fan her head! She’ll be feverish after so much thinking.</p>

<p>[<i>They fan her with bunches of leaves which blow her hair wildly.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Please—please—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She’s all right again now. Do you know languages? What’s the French for fiddle-de-dee?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Fiddle-de-dee’s not English.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Who ever said it was?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">If you tell me what language fiddle-de-dee is, I’ll tell you the French for it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Queens never make bargains!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I wish Queens never asked questions!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Don’t let us quarrel; what is the cause of lightning?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">The cause of lightning is the thunder—no, no! I meant the other way.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">It’s too late to correct it; when you’ve once said a thing, that fixes it,
and you must take the consequences.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">We had <i>such</i> a thunderstorm next Tuesday, you can’t think.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She <i>never</i> could, you know.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in—and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps—and knocking over the tables and
things—till I was so frightened, I couldn’t remember my own name!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I never should <i>try</i> to remember my name in the middle of an accident.
Where would be the use of it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">You must excuse her. She means well, but she can’t help saying foolish
things, as a general rule. She never was really well brought up, but it’s
amazing how good tempered she is! Pat her on the head, and see how pleased
she’ll be! A little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do
wonders with her.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Queen</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gives a deep sigh and leans her head on</i> <span class="smcap">Alice’s</span> <i>shoulder.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">I <i>am</i> so sleepy!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Red Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">She’s tired, poor thing; smooth her hair—lend her your night cap—and
sing her a soothing lullaby.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">I haven’t got a night cap with me, and I don’t know any soothing lullabies.</p>

<p class="dent">What do you know about this business?</p>

<p class="dent">Nothing whatever.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p>[<i>To the jury.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">That’s very important.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p class="dent"><i>Un</i>important, your Majesty means, of course.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent"><i>Un</i>important, of course I meant. Important—unimportant—unimportant—important. Consider your verdict!</p>

<p>[<i>Some of the jury write “important” and some write “unimportant.”</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p class="dent">There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty; this paper has just been picked up.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">What’s in it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p>[<i>Fumbles with a huge envelope.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>I haven’t opened it yet, but it seems to be a letter, written by the
prisoner to—to somebody.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">It must have been that unless it was written to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">Who is it directed to?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p class="dent">It isn’t directed at all; in fact, there’s nothing written on the <i>outside</i>.</p>

<p>[<i>Takes out a tiny piece of paper.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">It isn’t a letter at all; it’s a set of verses.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?</p>

<p>[<i>The jury brightens up.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looks at the</i> <span class="smcap">Knave’s</span> <i>hand.</i> <span class="smcap">Knave</span> <i>hides his hand; the chains
rattle.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">No, they’re not, and that’s the queerest thing about it.</p>

<p>[<i>The jury looks puzzled.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">He must have imitated somebody else’s hand!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Knave</span></p>

<p class="dent">Please, your Majesty, I didn’t write it and they can’t prove I did;
there’s no name signed at the end.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">If you didn’t sign it that only makes the matter worse. You <i>must</i> have
meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your name like an honest man.</p>

<p>[<i>At this there is a general clapping of hands.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">That <i>proves</i> his guilt.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">It proves nothing of the sort! Why, you don’t even know what they’re about.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">Read them!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">White Rabbit</span></p>

<p>[<i>Puts on his monocle.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?</p>

<p class="poem">“They told me you had been to her,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mentioned me to him;</span><br>
She gave me a good character,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But said I could not swim.</span><br>
<br>
“I gave her one, they gave him two,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">You gave us three or more;</span><br>
They all returned from him to you,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though they were mine before.</span><br>
<br>
“My notion was that you had been<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Before she had this fit)</span><br>
An obstacle that came between<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him, and ourselves, and it.</span><br>
<br>
“Don’t let him know she liked him best,<br>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For this must ever be</span><br>
A secret, kept from all the rest,<br>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet; so now let
the jury—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">If anyone of them can explain it, I’ll give him sixpence. I don’t believe
there’s an atom of meaning in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Jury</span></p>

<p class="dent">She doesn’t believe there’s an atom of meaning in it.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">If there’s no meaning in it, that saves a world of trouble, you know, as
we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know.</p>

<p>[<i>Spreads out the verses on his knee and studies them.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">I seem to see some meaning after all. “Said I could not swim.” You can’t
swim, can you?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Knave</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shakes his head sadly and points to his suit.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Do I look like it?</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">All right, so far; “We know it to be true,” that’s the jury, of course; “I
gave her one, they gave him two” why that must be what he did with the
tarts, you know—</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

<p class="dent">But it goes on “they all returned from <i>him</i> to <i>you</i>.”</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p>[<i>Triumphantly pointing to the tarts.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">Why, there they are! Nothing can be clearer than that. Then again, “before
she had this fit,” you never had fits, my dear, I think?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><br><span class="smcap">Queen</span></p>

<p class="dent">Never!</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">Then the words don’t <i>fit</i> you.</p>

<p>[<i>There is dead silence, while the</i> <span class="smcap">King</span> <i>looks around at the court with a
smile.</i>]</p>

<p class="dent">It’s a pun!</p>

<p>[<i>Everybody laughs. Music.</i>]</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">King</span></p>

<p class="dent">Let the jury consider their verdict.</p>

<p class="dent">No, no! Sentence first—verdict afterwards.</p>

<p><br><span class="smcap">Alice</span></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project

charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
